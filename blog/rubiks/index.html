            <h1>Group Theory, God's Number, and Rubik's Cubes</h1>
            <p class="date">November 13, 2024</p>
            <p>In 2010 it was shown that any Rubik's cube can be solved in 20 moves or less, a result referred to as "God's Number". While a large part of this discovery was made possible by the use of computational methods, it was also helped by group theory, a branch of mathematics concerned wiht symmetries and transformations. More specifically, the set of transformations one can apply to a Rubik's Cube is a group. Using group-theoretic concepts, researchers showed that there is always a sequence of at most 20 moves that will return a scrambled Rubik's cube to its solved state.</p>

            <h2>Group Theory</h2>
            <p>A set \(G\) is said to be a group under a binary operation \(*\) if it satisfies the following properties:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Closure</b>: For any two elements \(a, b\) in \(G\), their product is also in \(G\). <br/>
                        \(a, b \in G \implies a * b \in G\)</li>
                    <li><b>Associativity</b>: For \(a, b, c\) in \(G\), the order in which the group operation is applied does not matter. <br/>
                        \((a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\)</li>
                    <li><b>Existence of an Identity Element</b>: There is an identity element in \(G\) that does not affect any other element in \(G\). This is denoted as \(1\).<br/>
                        \(\exists 1 \in G \ s.t. \ 1 * a = a * 1 = a\)</li>
                    <li><b>Existence of Inverses</b>: For every element in \(G\), there exists an element in \(G\) so that the product of the element with its inverse is \(1\).<br />
                        \(\forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G \ s.t. \ a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = 1\)</li>
                </ul>
            As an example, consider the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) under addition. Closure is easy to verify; the sum of any two integers is always an integer. Associativity is also easy to verify. The identity element in the given example is \(0\) (a bit confusing with the notation of \(1\) for the identity element), and then the inverse of any integer \(a\) is simply \(-a\).

            <h2>Rubik's Cube Moves as Group Elements</h2>
            <p>A Rubik's cube is composed of 26 smaller cubes referred to as "cubies". The 26 cubies can be classified as follows: 6 center pieces, which do not move relative to each other, 12 edge cubies with 2 stickers each, and 8 corner cubies with 3 stickers each.</p>
            <p>In the most basic form, all moves on a Rubik's cube are some permuation of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>\(F\)</b>: Rotate the front face one quarter turn clockwise</li>
                    <li><b>\(B\)</b>: Rotate the back face one quarter turn clockwise</li>
                    <li><b>\(U\)</b>: Rotate the upper face one quarter turn clockwise</li>
                    <li><b>\(D\)</b>: Rotate the lower face one quarter turn clockwise</li>
                    <li><b>\(L\)</b>: Rotate the left hand side face one quarter turn clockwise</li>
                    <li><b>\(R\)</b>: Rotate the right hand side face one quarter turn clockwise</li>
                </ul>
                Many other moves of course exist, but they are all constructible from the above moves. In other words, the set of Rubik's cube moves is generated by \(\{F, B, U, D, L, R\}\). For example, the counterclockwise rotation of the front face by one quarter turn is equivalent to three clockwise rotations of the front face.</p>
            <p>The set of all Rubik's Cube moves forms a under composition. This group satisfies the four properties of closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility, and it is a subgroup of the symmetric group \( S_{48} \), which describes all possible permutations of the cube's 48 movable pieces (excluding the 6 fixed center pieces). The Rubik's cube's state and \(S_{48}\) are not isomorphic (i.e. there does not exist a one-to-one map between them), because the Rubik's cube is restricted by some additional constrains (e.g. corner cubies must always be in a corner, edge cubies must always be at an edge, center pieces remain fixed, etc.).</p>
            <p>It is also important to note that the elements of this group do not commute. For example, \(FR\) (applying \(F\) then \(R\)) does not give the same result as \(RF\) (applying \(R\) then \(F\)). However, if two moves do not affect any common squares, they will commute (considering the group of moves as a subgroup of \(S_{48}\), this is equivalent to saying that disjoint cycles commute).</p>

            <h2>More on Rubik's Cube Moves as Group Elements</h2>
            <p>To further formalize the idea of commutation above, define the commutator. For any two moves \(A, B\), their commutator is defined as \([A, B] = ABA^{-1}B^{-1}\). \(A\) and \(B\) commute iff \([A, B] = 1\). A good way to think about the commutator is as measuring the <i>failure</i> of two moves to commute.</p>
            <p>A new composition of moves can also be defined as \(CAC^{-1}\), referred to as the <i>conjugate</i> of \(A\). Intuitively, conjugations do the same type of thing, but in different places.</p>
            <p>Going back to our previous observation that \(G\) is a subgroup of \(S_{48}\), we can show further correspondence to other well-understood groups. One such example is given by labeling all non-center cubies with a number from 1 to 20. Then, examining how the group of moves permutes those cubies gives a homomorphism from the group of moves to \(S_{20}\) (a homomorphism is a map from one group to another that maintains the structure of the group). Similarly, labeling the edge stickers with a number from 1 to 24 reveals a homomorphism from the group of moves to \(S_{24}\).</p>
            <p>Using these homomorphisms, several statements can be proven including, but not limited to, two cubies cannot be switched, a single edge cannot be flipped, and a single corner cannot be rotated. The proofs are not shown as this is intended to be a more expository post, but they are covered briefly in Michael Hutching's Bay Area Math Circle Colloquium Presentation (linked below in references and further reading).</p>

            <h2>How Group Theory Helped Identify God's Number</h2>
            <p>While it's undoubtedly interesting how one can use group theory to model Rubik's cube moves, the connection between group theory and God's number is not immediately obvious. By studying Rubik's cubes with group theory, researchers were able to identify symmetries and impossibilities, reducing the computational complexity of a computer algorithm to find God's number. Although the algorithm still ran for approximately 35 CPU years, the use of group theory significantly decreased the time necessary.</p>
